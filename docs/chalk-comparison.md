## Why the Gap?

### chalk

The chalk maintainer's position on extended underlines ([GitHub Issue #604](https://github.com/chalk/chalk/issues/604)):

> "No. It's not widely supported in terminals... We'll consider adding it, but I'd like to see some more terminal adoption first."

As of 2025, support has expanded significantly:
- Ghostty, Kitty, WezTerm, iTerm2, Foot, VTE-based terminals

chalkx fills this gap while remaining a thin layer on chalk.

### Other Libraries

picocolors, colorette, and kleur focus on **size and speed** over features. They intentionally omit advanced styling to minimize bundle size.

ansis focuses on **performance** and API ergonomics but hasn't added extended underlines.

## Size Comparison

| Package | Size (dist) | Dependencies |
|---------|-------------|--------------|
| picocolors | ~2 KB | 0 |
| colorette | ~3 KB | 0 |
| kleur | ~4 KB | 0 |
| ansis | ~3 KB | 0 |
| chalk | ~5 KB | 0 |
| chalkx | ~4 KB | 1 (chalk) |

chalkx adds minimal overhead (~4 KB) on top of chalk.

## Performance

chalkx performance is essentially chalk's performance because:
- Extended underlines are simple string concatenation
- Terminal detection is cached (runs once)
- No runtime overhead for standard chalk operations

For performance-critical applications with millions of style operations, consider using chalk directly for colors and chalkx only for extended features.

## When to Use chalkx

**Use chalkx when you need:**
- Curly underlines (spell check, error highlighting)
- Colored underlines (semantic highlighting)
- Clickable hyperlinks in terminal output
- All of chalk's features plus extensions

**Use chalk alone when:**
- You only need colors and basic modifiers
- You're not targeting modern terminals

**Use picocolors/colorette when:**
- Bundle size is critical
- You only need basic colors
- Performance is more important than features

## Migration from chalk

chalkx is a drop-in extension of chalk:

```ts
// Before
import chalk from 'chalk';
console.log(chalk.red('error'));

// After (option 1: add features, keep chalk imports)
import chalk from 'chalk';
import { curlyUnderline } from '@beorn/chalkx';
console.log(chalk.red('error'));
console.log(curlyUnderline('misspelled'));

// After (option 2: single import)
import { chalk, curlyUnderline } from '@beorn/chalkx';
console.log(chalk.red('error'));
console.log(curlyUnderline('misspelled'));
```

No breaking changes. Add chalkx alongside chalk and use extended features as needed.
